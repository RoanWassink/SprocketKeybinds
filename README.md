# Sprocket Keybinds

A shared keybind menu for Sprocket mods, grouped by author or declared mod pack.

**v0.1.5 — beta.** Configure mod controls inside the vanilla Settings menu. Expand author/mod groups, switch between author and pack grouping, and use Clear, Reset, Apply, Accept and Cancel. Personalized bindings survive updates.

## Requirements

- Sprocket **0.2.55.5**, Windows x64, Unity 6000.3.21f1.
- A working **Sprocket Mod Loader / BepInEx 6 IL2CPP (6.0.0-be.788)** setup with its runtime and generated interop. Loader installation is separate. Stock BepInEx alone is not claimed equivalent to the tested Sprocket-specific setup.
- Quality of Life is not required or included. Other game versions have not been verified.

## Install and update

1. Install a working Sprocket Mod Loader / BepInEx 6 IL2CPP setup, run Sprocket once, then close it. The loader is a separate prerequisite and is not included.
2. Download **SprocketKeybinds-v0.1.5.zip** from [this release](https://github.com/RoanWassink/SprocketKeybinds/releases/tag/v0.1.5).
3. In Steam, use Sprocket > Manage > Browse local files. Copy the ZIP's folders into the folder containing Sprocket.exe. Merge folders; keep the internal structure intact.
4. Keep one copy of each plugin. Back up matching mod files and vehicle saves before updating. Never replace the whole BepInEx folder.
5. Preserve existing BepInEx/config files, customized thermal-models.json and sound overrides. Install required dependencies separately. Restart the game.

## Usage, controls and settings

Open Settings > Controls/keybinds > Mod keybinds > Open. Expand an author, then a mod. Clear unbinds a slot; Reset restores its factory default. Apply saves, Accept saves and closes, Cancel returns to the last applied bindings. Author/pack grouping changes display only. Storage: BepInEx/config/sprocket.keybinds.json; keep its .bak for recovery. Mods must opt into this API; it does not automatically add every installed mod's controls. [API integration](INTEGRATION.md) explains registration, dependencies and metadata for other modders.

## Troubleshooting, saves and rollback

If the mod is absent, check BepInEx/LogOutput.log for the mod name, missing dependencies, duplicate plugin versions or invalid configuration. When this mod requires Keybinds, missing/incompatible Keybinds causes the mod to be skipped; old direct-key CFG entries do not replace that requirement. Preserve a malformed file for inspection instead of overwriting all your settings. Restart after repairs.

Restore your backed-up mod files and settings together for rollback. Do not delete an entire shared folder. Custom parts/materials may be referenced by vehicle saves: return affected vehicles to stock parts/materials and save before uninstalling. Keep save backups; installed mods and release archives do not back up every vehicle automatically.

## Where to get the separate loader

Use [Hans21223's Sprocket Mod Loader](https://github.com/Hans21223/Sprocket-Mod-Loader) and follow its [manual installation guide](https://github.com/Hans21223/Sprocket-Mod-Loader/blob/main/package/MANUAL-INSTALL.md) or its documented manager installation. That upstream project targets the tested Sprocket version and supplies the Sprocket-specific patch. These mod downloads do not install the loader. Follow one upstream loader method and its update/backup instructions; the creator's supplied ModManager archive is not redistributed here.
